I have seggregated the whole solution into folders
Folders have necessary project inside it serving its own purpose
Some of the things I have assumed, ORM implementation,  to be precise entity framework

Below is the architecture

API Endpoint(Controller)-> Service Layer- Repository Layer- DBContext-DBContext-Database
Unit Test Case-> Service Layer- Repository Layer- DBContext-DBContext-Database

Repository classs has all the methods for interacting with dbcontext(entity framework class)
repository class is injected into service layer class
service layer class inturn would be used in controller class 

api class is the controller class, which is currently empty

There are code commented in reposiory class it is for better understanding

Please run the test case

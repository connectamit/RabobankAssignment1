I have seggregated the whole solution into folders
Folders have necessary project inside it serving its own purpose
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

API folder(Empty)
Which will have all the controllers Controller

Domain Folder
has two projects
Domain project library-which will have all the interfaces and models
Domain implementation project library-which will have the inplementation of all the interfaces

External Folder
External project library- which has external library

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the things I have assumed, ORM implementation,  to be precise entity framework

Below is the architecture

API Endpoint(Controller)-> Service Layer- Repository Layer- DBContext-DBContext-Database
Unit Test Case-> Service Layer- Repository Layer- DBContext-DBContext-Database
